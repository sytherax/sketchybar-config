# Utility Bar - Rosé Pine Moon

This is a config I made which aggregate functionnality and aesthetics.

See https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/discussions/47?sort=new#discussioncomment-14058252

> [!WARNING] 
> Some of the functionnalities of the bar are not working currently in MacOS Tahoe.

## Install :
